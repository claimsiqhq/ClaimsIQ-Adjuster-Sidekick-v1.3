# Final Crash Analysis

## What We Know:
1. ✅ Supabase connection works
2. ✅ Login works  
3. ✅ Database queries work
4. ✅ Profiles RLS fixed (infinite recursion removed)
5. ✅ All files exist
6. ❌ App still crashes on launch

## What Happens:
- White screen flashes instantly
- "Home screen tries to load"
- Crashes before showing anything
- Never reaches login screen

## Most Likely Cause:
One of the tab screens (index, today, capture, etc.) is crashing on initial load before auth check completes.

## To Debug:
Need to see actual React Native error logs from your iPhone.

Options:
1. Connect iPhone to Mac → Xcode → Devices → View logs
2. Use: eas build --profile development (dev client shows errors)
3. Shake iPhone → Copy crash log → Send to me

Without seeing the actual error, I'm guessing.
