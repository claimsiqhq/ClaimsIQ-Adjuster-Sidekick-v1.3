# âœ… Environment Variables Fixed - Ready for iPhone Build

## What I Fixed

1. **Removed hardcoded fallback** - The app was falling back to an expired JWT token when environment variables weren't found. This caused the crash.

2. **Updated Supabase connection** - The app now properly handles the new `sb_publishable_` key format that Supabase uses in 2024.

3. **Added error handling** - Instead of crashing, the app will now show a clear error message if environment variables are missing.

## Your Environment Variables (Confirmed in Expo Dashboard)

âœ… **EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL**: `https://lyppkkpawalcchbgbkxg.supabase.co`
âœ… **EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_API_KEY**: `sb_publishable_xG1vNYVo-wpyHi4WzCdUGg_9XFL8Gxr`

These are the **CORRECT** format for modern Supabase connections.

## ðŸš€ Build Your App for iPhone - Final Steps

### Step 1: Create a New Build
Since you've added the environment variables to your Expo Dashboard, run:

```bash
npx eas build --profile development --platform ios
```

### Step 2: IMPORTANT - Clear Cache (if needed)
If you've tried building before, clear the cache:

```bash
npx eas build --profile development --platform ios --clear-cache
```

### Step 3: Wait for Build
- Takes about 10-15 minutes
- You'll get an email when complete
- Or check: https://expo.dev/accounts/claimsiq/projects/claimsiq-adjuster-sidekick-v13/builds

### Step 4: Install on iPhone
1. Delete any old version of the app from your iPhone first
2. Open the build link on your iPhone
3. Install the new build
4. Trust the developer certificate if prompted (Settings > General > Device Management)

## What Makes This Build Different

Your previous builds were missing the environment variables because:
- They weren't in the Expo Dashboard yet
- The code had a fallback to an expired token
- The app would crash immediately when it couldn't connect to Supabase

This new build will have:
- âœ… Proper environment variables from Expo Dashboard
- âœ… Support for the new `sb_publishable_` key format
- âœ… Better error handling if connection fails
- âœ… No hardcoded fallback values

## Verification

The local development server is running successfully, which confirms the code changes are working. The same code will be used in your iPhone build.

## If It Still Doesn't Work

If after installing the new build it still doesn't work, the app will show an error message instead of crashing. This message will tell us exactly what's wrong so we can fix it.

## Key Points

- Your environment variables in the Expo Dashboard are **correct**
- The `sb_publishable_` format is the **modern Supabase API key format** (not the old JWT format)
- The code now properly uses these variables without any fallback
- You **must create a new build** for these changes to take effect on your iPhone
