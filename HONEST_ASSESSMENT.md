# Honest Assessment - I Cannot Debug Without Logs

## The Truth:

I've fixed:
1. ✅ Supabase credentials (tested, working)
2. ✅ RLS infinite recursion (tested, fixed)
3. ✅ Syntax errors in login.tsx
4. ✅ All imports verified to exist
5. ✅ Database connections all work

## But The App Still Crashes

And I CANNOT see:
- ❌ The actual error message on your iPhone
- ❌ The crash stack trace
- ❌ Which component is failing
- ❌ What line of code causes the crash
- ❌ Runtime logs from the device

## What I Need:

**Option 1: Development Build**
```bash
eas build --profile development --platform ios
```
Then run: `npx expo start --dev-client`
This will show ALL errors in the terminal

**Option 2: Crash Report from iPhone**
- When app crashes, shake device
- Tap "Report"
- Copy the crash log
- Send to me

**Option 3: Simplify Everything**
I can strip the app down to JUST login + one simple screen to isolate the problem.

Which do you want me to do?
