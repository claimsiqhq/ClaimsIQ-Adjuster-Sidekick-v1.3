## About the Console Warning

The "port in use" warning is ONLY for dev server (local development).
EAS Build doesn't use the dev server - it's cloud-based.
You can ignore that warning.

## If You Want LiDAR Later

We can add it back after the app is stable, using:
1. A properly tested plugin, OR
2. Manual Xcode configuration, OR
3. A different approach entirely

For now: **Build without LiDAR, get a working app!**
