## 🎯 What This Means

### Offline Sync Will Work:
- `updated_at` columns present everywhere
- Conflict resolution can compare timestamps
- No sync errors

### Foreign Keys Behave Correctly:
- Delete claim → documents cascade deleted ✓
- Delete claim → media stays, claim_id set to null ✓
- Data integrity maintained ✓

### Array Fields Work:
- Routes store claim IDs properly ✓
- Documents can have multiple tags ✓
- TypeScript types match database ✓

### Data Validation:
- extraction_confidence 0.00 to 1.00 enforced ✓
- All enums have proper CHECK constraints ✓
- Required fields enforced ✓
