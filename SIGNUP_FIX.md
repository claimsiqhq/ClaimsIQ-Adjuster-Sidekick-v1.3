# 🔧 Signup Issue Fixed!

## What Was Wrong

1. **RLS Policy Issue** ✅ FIXED
   - The profiles table had restrictive RLS that prevented signup
   - Fixed: Now authenticated users can insert their own profile

2. **Email Confirmation Issue** ⚠️ NEEDS MANUAL FIX
   - Supabase is sending confirmation emails with localhost URLs
   - These don't work on mobile devices

## ✅ What I Fixed

The RLS policies are now corrected:
- ✅ Anyone can read profiles
- ✅ Authenticated users can create their own profile
- ✅ Users can update their own profile
- ✅ Admins have full access

## 🔧 What You Need to Do

To allow signup without email confirmation, go to Supabase dashboard:

1. **Go to:** https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/lyppkkpawalcchbgbkxg/auth/users

2. **Click:** "Configuration" in the left sidebar

3. **Find:** "Email Auth" section

4. **Toggle OFF:** "Enable email confirmations"

5. **Save** the settings

### Why This Matters

For a mobile app, email confirmation creates problems:
- ❌ Emails have localhost URLs that don't work on phones
- ❌ Users can't complete signup without checking email
- ❌ Bad user experience

By disabling email confirmation:
- ✅ Users can sign up instantly
- ✅ No email verification needed
- ✅ Better mobile experience

## 🎯 After Disabling Email Confirmation

Try creating your account again on the phone:

1. Enter email: `john.shoust@pm.me`
2. Enter password: `admin123`
3. Tap **"Create/Ensure Admin"**
4. Should work immediately! No email needed
5. Then tap **"Sign In"**

## Alternative: Use Supabase Dashboard to Create User

If you want to create the user manually:

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/lyppkkpawalcchbgbkxg/auth/users
2. Click "Add user" → "Create new user"
3. Enter email: `john.shoust@pm.me`
4. Enter password: `admin123`
5. Toggle "Auto Confirm User" to ON
6. Click "Create user"
7. Then go to SQL Editor and run:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO public.profiles (id, email, display_name, is_admin)
   VALUES (
     (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'john.shoust@pm.me'),
     'john.shoust@pm.me',
     'John Shoust',
     true
   );
   ```
8. Now you can login on your phone!
