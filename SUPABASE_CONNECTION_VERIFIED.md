## 🚀 Next Step: Build Your App

Your app is now ready! Build it with:

```bash
eas build --platform ios --profile preview
```

### What This Will Do:
1. ✅ Create a **standalone app** (not a dev client)
2. ✅ Include Supabase credentials automatically
3. ✅ Connect to database when the app launches
4. ✅ Work without needing a development server
5. ✅ Install on your iPhone via QR code

### After the Build:
1. Open the install link on your iPhone
2. Install the app
3. **The app will open normally** (no URL prompt!)
4. You can:
   - Sign in or create an account
   - Take photos for claims
   - Create and manage claims
   - Store media files

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- Write operations require authentication (by design)
- The app will authenticate users on login
- Once authenticated, users can create claims and upload photos

### Database Schema
Your Supabase database has:
- User authentication via Supabase Auth
- Proper foreign key relationships
- JSON fields for flexible data storage
- Automatic timestamps (created_at, updated_at)
- RLS policies for security

### What Changed:
1. ✅ Added `eas.json` env vars for all build profiles
2. ✅ Created missing database tables (claims, media, profiles)
3. ✅ Applied RLS policies
4. ✅ Seeded AI prompt templates
5. ✅ Verified storage bucket access

## 📱 Expected Behavior

### Before (Development Build):
- ❌ App asked for a URL
- ❌ Needed dev server running
- ❌ No database connection

### After (Preview Build):
- ✅ App opens to login screen
- ✅ Direct database connection
- ✅ Fully functional standalone app
- ✅ No dev server needed
