# ✅ Tab Navigation Fixed!

## What Was Wrong

The `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` file had the **wrong layout code**:
- ❌ It had a **Stack** layout (no tabs)
- ❌ This caused the app to show only one screen with no navigation
- ❌ The tab bar was completely missing

## What I Fixed

1. **Replaced the tabs layout** with proper `Tabs` component from expo-router
2. **Added all 7 tab screens:**
   - 🏠 Home (index)
   - 📅 Today
   - 📷 Capture
   - 📁 Claims
   - 🗺️ Map
   - 🔍 Explore
   - ⚙️ Settings

3. **Configured tab bar styling:**
   - Purple accent color for active tabs
   - Proper sizing for iOS/Android
   - Emoji icons as placeholders

4. **Fixed root layout** to properly show tabs after login

## 🚀 Next Steps

**You need to rebuild the app for this to work:**

```bash
eas build --platform ios --profile preview
```

After the build completes:
1. Install the new version on your iPhone
2. Login with: `john@claimsiq.ai` / `admin123`
3. You'll now see the full tab bar at the bottom
4. You can navigate between all 7 screens

## 📱 What You'll See

After rebuilding, you'll have a proper tab bar with:
- All tabs visible at the bottom
- Ability to switch between screens
- Full navigation throughout the app

The current build on your phone has the old broken layout - you need to rebuild for the fix to work!
