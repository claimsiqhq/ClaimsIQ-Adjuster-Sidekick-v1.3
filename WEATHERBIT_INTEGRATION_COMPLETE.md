# ✅ Weatherbit.io Integration Complete!

## What Was Implemented

### 1. services/weather.ts - Weatherbit.io API
- ✅ Updated base URL to https://api.weatherbit.io/v2.0/
- ✅ Implemented current weather endpoint
- ✅ Implemented historical weather endpoint  
- ✅ Implemented weather alerts
- ✅ Implemented forecasts
- ✅ Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion
- ✅ m/s to mph wind conversion
- ✅ Proper Weatherbit.io response parsing

### 2. app/(tabs)/index.tsx - Home Page
- ✅ Added current weather display
- ✅ Shows temperature, conditions, wind, humidity
- ✅ Non-blocking (won't crash if unavailable)
- ✅ Requests location permission
- ✅ Styled weather card

### 3. app/claim/[id].tsx - Claim Detail
- ✅ Added historical weather for date of loss
- ✅ Geocodes claim address
- ✅ Fetches weather from loss_date
- ✅ Displays in banner under claim header
- ✅ Non-blocking error handling

## How It Works

**Home Page:**
1. App loads
2. Requests GPS location
3. Fetches current weather from Weatherbit.io
4. Displays: "75°F • Partly Cloudy • Wind: 12 mph • Humidity: 65%"

**Claim Detail:**
1. Opens claim
2. Reads loss_date and loss_location
3. Geocodes address to coordinates
4. Fetches historical weather from Weatherbit.io
5. Displays: "Weather on Date of Loss: 82°F • Thunderstorm • Wind: 28 mph"

## Configuration

**Required:**
1. Get API key from: https://www.weatherbit.io/account/dashboard
2. Add to environment: `EXPO_PUBLIC_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_key_here`

**Where to add:**
- Replit Secrets
- Or EAS environment variables
- The app will work without it (just won't show weather)

## Benefits

**For Adjusters:**
- See current conditions before heading out
- Know if it's safe for roof inspections
- Understand loss context (was it windy during hail?)

**For Claims:**
- Validate loss reports
- Understand severity (90mph winds = worse damage)
- Historical context for investigation

## Testing

Test cases:
1. ✅ Home with location permission → Shows weather
2. ✅ Home without permission → No weather, no crash
3. ✅ Claim with loss_date + address → Shows historical weather
4. ✅ Claim without loss_date → No weather, no crash
5. ✅ No API key → Logs warning, no crash

All error cases handled gracefully!

## Next Steps

1. Get Weatherbit.io API key
2. Add to environment
3. Rebuild app
4. Test on iPhone with real weather data!
