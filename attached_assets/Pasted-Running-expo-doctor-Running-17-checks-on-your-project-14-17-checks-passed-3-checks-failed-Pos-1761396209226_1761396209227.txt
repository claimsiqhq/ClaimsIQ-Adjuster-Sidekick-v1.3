‚úñ Check for legacy global CLI installed locally
EAS CLI should not be installed in your project. Instead, install it globally or use "npx", "pnpx", or "bunx" depending on your preferred package manager.
Advice:
Remove eas-cli from your project dependencies.

‚úñ Validate packages against React Native Directory package metadata
The following issues were found when validating your dependencies against React Native Directory:
  Untested on New Architecture: react-native-nitro-sound
  No metadata available: react-native-pdf-lib
Advice:
Use libraries that are actively maintained and support the New Architecture. Find alternative libraries with https://reactnative.directory.
Add packages to expo.doctor.reactNativeDirectoryCheck.exclude in package.json to selectively skip validations, if the warning is not relevant.
Update React Native Directory to include metadata for unknown packages. Alternatively, set expo.doctor.reactNativeDirectoryCheck.listUnknownPackages in package.json to false to skip warnings about packages with no metadata, if the warning is not relevant.

‚úñ Check that packages match versions required by installed Expo SDK
