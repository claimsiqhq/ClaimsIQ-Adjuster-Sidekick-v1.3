You are extracting structured data from a First Notice of Loss (FNOL) document. 
Return ONLY a single JSON object that exactly matches the target schema below (same keys, same nesting, same order). 
Do not include any commentary, explanations, or additional keys.

DOCUMENT STYLE & LABELS
- The document is a “Homeowners Vendor Assignment” style FNOL and contains blocks labeled like:
  - “Date Prepared”, “Policy & Insured Information”, “Adjuster Information”, “Loss Information”, 
    “Reporting Party & Official Reports”, “Contact & Witness Information” (if present).
- Common field labels include (not exhaustive): 
  “Carrier Name”, “Claim Number”, “Policy Number”, “Policy Period”, “Insured Name”, 
  “Insured Mailing Address”, “Agency Name”, “Agency Phone”, 
  “Adjuster Assigned”, “Adjuster E-mail”, “Adjuster Phone Number”, “Extension”, 
  “Claim Type”, “Cause of Loss”, “Date of Loss”, “Time of Loss”, “Loss Location”, 
  “Loss Description”, “Description of Damage”, “Estimated Loss”, 
  “Reporter’s Name”, “Caller Type”, “Business Phone”, “Cell Phone”, “E-mail Address”, “Extension”, 
  “Reported to Police”, “Fire Department Involved”. 
- Page order matters; read all pages, top-to-bottom, left-to-right.

MAPPING RULES
- assignmentBy: If the header says “Homeowners Vendor Assignment by <Org>”, extract <Org>; otherwise null.
- carrierName: From “Carrier Name”.
- datePrepared: From “Date Prepared”.
- policyDetails.policyNumber: From “Policy Number”.
- policyDetails.claimNumber: From “Claim Number”.
- policyDetails.policyPeriod: Copy the full “Policy Period” string exactly as written (e.g., “MM/DD/YYYY to MM/DD/YYYY”).
- policyHolder.insuredName: From “Insured Name”.
- policyHolder.insuredAddress: From “Insured Mailing Address”.
- agency.agencyName / agency.agencyPhone: From “Agency Name” / “Agency Phone”.
- adjustor.* : From “Adjuster Information”. Map “Adjuster Assigned” → adjustorAssigned; 
  “Adjuster E-mail” → adjustorEmail; “Adjuster Phone Number” → adjustorPhoneNumber; “Extension” → adjustorExtension.
- lossDetails: 
  - claimType: If a claim type is explicitly listed, use it. Otherwise default to “Property Damage”.
  - causeOfLoss: From “Cause of Loss”.
  - dateOfLoss / timeOfLoss: From “Date of Loss” / “Time of Loss”.
  - lossLocation: From “Loss Location”.
  - lossDescription: From “Loss Description”.
  - descriptionOfDamage: If a separate “Description of Damage” field exists, extract verbatim; else null.
  - estimatedLoss: From “Estimated Loss”.
  - additionalInformation: Any extra text in the loss section that doesn’t fit elsewhere (e.g., qualifiers like 
    “Information limited and unverified...”); otherwise null.
- reporterInfo: 
  - reportersName: From “Reporter’s Name”.
  - callerType: From “Caller Type”.
  - callerHomePhone: From “Home Phone” if present; else null.
  - callerCellPhone: From “Cell Phone”.
  - callerBusinessPhone: From “Business Phone”.
  - callerEmailAddress: From “E-mail Address”.
  - callerExtension: From “Extension” in the reporting block (not the adjuster block).
- officialReports:
  - reportedToPolice / fireDepartmentInvolved: Map “Yes”/“No” to booleans true/false; if absent, null.
  - policeDepartment, policeReportNumber, fireDepartment, fireReportNumber: If explicitly listed; else null.
- additionalContacts: 
  - If the document includes a “Contact & Witness Information” section, push each person as an object. 
  - If none exist, keep a single object with all fields null (as in schema).
- miscellaneous: Leave null unless the document explicitly contains such details.

NORMALIZATION RULES
- Dates: Convert to ISO 8601 date strings “YYYY-MM-DD” when unambiguous (e.g., “07/08/2024” → “2024-07-08”). 
  If the month/day order is certain from context, convert; if ambiguous, leave the original string.
- Times: Keep as seen (e.g., “12:00 AM”, “5:00 PM”).
- Phones: Normalize to E.164 when possible (US/Canada: “+1XXXXXXXXXX”). If formatting can’t be safely inferred, keep original.
- Emails: Lowercase and trim.
- Currency: For “Estimated Loss”, extract numeric value as a string with currency symbol preserved if present (e.g., “$0.00”). 
  If the field explicitly says “Initial report, pending inspection”, still set estimatedLoss to the numeric/currency literal if present.
- Booleans: Map “Yes”→true, “No”→false. If blank/missing, null.
- Text: Preserve punctuation and casing from the document for descriptive fields (lossDescription, descriptionOfDamage).

ROBUSTNESS
- The PDF may be multi-page. Read all pages and merge fields.
- Sections may be missing; set those keys to null (do NOT drop keys).
- Labels may vary slightly (e.g., “Adjuster E-mail” vs “Adjuster Email”); match by meaning.
- If both “Loss Description” and a narrative paragraph appear, place the labeled line in lossDescription, 
  and longer narrative or disclaimers in additionalInformation.
- If a field has multiple instances (e.g., multiple contacts), populate the array accordingly.
- If OCR noise causes uncertain characters, resolve by context (e.g., email/phone patterns, address patterns, US ZIP formats). 
  When uncertain, prefer null over hallucination.

OUTPUT
- Return exactly one JSON object conforming to the schema above.
- No markdown, no code fences, no extra text.
