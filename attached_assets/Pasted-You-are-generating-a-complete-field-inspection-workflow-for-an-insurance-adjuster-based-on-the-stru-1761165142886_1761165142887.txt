You are generating a complete field inspection workflow for an insurance adjuster, based on the structured First Notice of Loss (FNOL) data provided below.

### FNOL INPUT
{{FNOL_JSON}}

### OBJECTIVE
Create a detailed workflow in JSON form that guides the adjuster (and any supporting roles) from initial file review through field inspection and reporting. 
Each workflow must dynamically reflect:
- The **cause of loss**, **property type**, **jurisdiction**, and **reported damages**.
- Real-world field conditions, including weather verification, travel, PPE, safety, exterior–interior inspection order, data collection, and documentation.
- Additional context when provided (e.g., multiple structures, fences, trees, interior damage, vehicles).

### LOGIC RULES FOR WORKFLOW GENERATION

#### 1. UNIVERSAL PRE-INSPECTION PHASE
Always include:
- **Step 1: File Review & Weather Verification**
  - Confirm date/time of loss matches a legitimate event using NOAA or similar.
  - Required artifacts: weather report link or screenshot.
- **Step 2: Travel Planning**
  - Compute travel time dynamically from current device geolocation to the FNOL loss location.
  - Required artifacts: GPS route and ETA screenshot.
- **Step 3: Safety & PPE Setup**
  - Mandate PPE and hazard assessment.
  - Tools: hard hat, gloves, vest, harness if roof access needed.

#### 2. ON-SITE EXTERIOR INSPECTION SEQUENCE
Follow clockwise “walkaround” from the **front** of the structure.
Include these defaults:
- Front elevation, right side, rear, left side
- Roof, fencing, detached structures, trees, and utilities
- For catastrophe claims, add drone aerial if available.

If the FNOL cause of loss includes:
- **Wind or Hail:** add roof slope, shingle, gutter, fascia, and ridge checks.
- **Water:** add drainage, sump pump, grading, and basement perimeter.
- **Fire:** add electrical panel, attic, smoke pattern, and odor documentation.
- **Tree Impact:** add tree base, impact zone, debris path.
- **Vehicle Impact:** add collision point, vehicle tag/photo, structural alignment.
- **Catastrophe:** add catastrophe claim ID correlation, community photos, and mapping overlay.

#### 3. INTERIOR INSPECTION SEQUENCE
Include “Enter structure after exterior clearance.”
Default order: entry → main level → upper level → attic → crawl/basement.
Checklist areas:
- Ceilings, walls, floors, windows, and attic framing.
- Use moisture meter or thermal camera when applicable.
- Document pre-existing vs. new damage separately.

#### 4. ADDITIONAL TASKS (DYNAMIC)
Add steps dynamically if indicated in FNOL:
- **Vehicles involved:** add vehicle inspection subworkflow.
- **Multiple structures:** add per-building sections.
- **Injuries or fire dept mention:** add official report retrieval step.
- **Agency or vendor names present:** include coordination step with their contact.

#### 5. POST-INSPECTION & REPORTING
Always include:
- **Interview Insured/Witness**
- **Compile Event Verification** (weather, police, or fire)
- **Estimate & Report Creation** (Xactimate or equivalent)
- **File Upload & QA Review**

#### 6. CHECKLIST ENRICHMENT
Generate checklist sections based on cause of loss and property area.
Examples:
- Roof Inspection
- Exterior Envelope
- Interior Damage
- Utilities & Systems
- Safety / PPE Compliance

#### 7. ISSUES TO WATCH FOR
Suggest potential red flags, such as:
- No supporting weather data
- Maintenance-related wear mistaken for storm damage
- Duplicate claims at same address
- Unsafe ladder or electrical hazards

#### 8. JURISDICTIONAL NUANCES
- **Texas (TX):** confirm wind/hail deductible disclosure, TWIA verification if coastal.
- **Tennessee (TN):** confirm state storm reporting and tree liability if neighboring property.
- **Connecticut (CT):** ensure license display for mitigation vendors.
- **Pennsylvania (PA):** verify public adjuster involvement disclosure.
- **Missouri (MO):** include catastrophe code linking for large events.

#### 9. DATA INTEGRITY
Ensure every step is well-labeled, has an objective, expected deliverables, and an estimated time.  
Prefer field realism over academic completeness.

#### 10. OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
- Produce only valid JSON matching the schema.
- No markdown, commentary, or additional text.
- Use plain English for step titles and objectives.
- Include estimatedTimeMinutes for every step, typically totaling 3–6 hours.
- For travel time, use a dynamic expression: `"auto:device_distance"`.
